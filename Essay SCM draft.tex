\section{Synthetic Control Methods}
Synthetic Control Methods have been originally proposed in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and by Abadie et al. (2010) to estimate the effects of aggregate interventions.
The key idea behind the method is that when the units of analysis are a few aggregate entities, a "synthetic control" that combines them can be a better counterfactual.
Such a control is computed as a weighted average of all potential comparison units that best resemble the treated units.
