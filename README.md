# About this folder
In this folder you can read my paper researching Synthetic Control Method applications to the field of Climate Change academic analysis. The final paper is the document titled [Assessing the Effectiveness of Synthetic Control Methods in Climate Change Analysis](Essay%20SCM%20draft.pdf).

All of this was done during a research period at the École Normale Supérieure, under the supervision of Professor Marc Fleurbaey and sponsored by the ENS and the Galilean School of Higher Education.


## How is this folder organized?
The "Papers" folder contains the main papers used to write the essay, roughly organised in sub-folders that resemble the chapters of the essay itself. Most of them are also annotated. There are some extra random papers in there that are off-topic.
