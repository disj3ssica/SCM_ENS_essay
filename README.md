*How to use work on this on any device and sync changes?

To access a directory via VS Code on multiple devices, you can use a version control system such as Git to synchronize your codebase across your devices. Here are the general steps:

Set up a Git repository for your project, either on a hosting service like GitHub or on a local Git server.

1. Clone the repository on each device where you want to work on the project.

2. Make changes to the project files on one device and commit them to the repository.

3. Push the changes to the Git server.

4. Pull the changes from the Git server on your other devices to update your local codebase.

5. Once you have set up your Git repository and cloned it on your devices, you can open the project directory in VS Code on each device and start editing the code. When you are ready to synchronize changes between devices, commit and push the changes to the Git repository, and then pull them down to your other devices.

Note that you may also need to configure your Git repository to handle any conflicts that arise when changes are made to the same file on multiple devices. You can use Git's merging and branching features to manage conflicts and collaborate with other developers.
